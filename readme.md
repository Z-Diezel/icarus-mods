A portable ice-infused elanthium cryogenic canister to keep perishables from spoiling. Crafted at the Fabricator from 10 Iron Ingot, 6 Aluminum Ingot, 3 Carbon Paste, 4 Exotics, and 18 Ice. Has 10 slots.

This mod uses the Hydrazine Canister asset, so it should be compatible with future updates.
Known "issue": automatically places picked-up spoiled meat into the inventory. I've tried to prevent this in the code to no avail. Suggestions/corrections are welcome.

Field Guide Description:

Don't stick your hand or other body parts in it for too long...
